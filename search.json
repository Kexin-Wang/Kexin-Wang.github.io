Here is my [PPT](img/Kexin_Wang_Interim_Presentation_for_Junzheng_Program.pdf.pdf), which roughly concludes what I have accomplished during 2020 spring semester and the summer vacation. Currently I am working on the dynamics of mismatched atom array.","tags":["project"],"categories":["project"]},{"title":"Light-atom interaction","url":"/2020/07/18/light-atom interaction/","content":"### Light-Atom Interaction\n\nTo build the quantum devices, understanding the light-atoms interaction is fundamental. Atoms are usually treated as dipoles in the electromagnetic field, but the latest experimental concerned with the collective decay rate conflicts with it.  \nPersonal project sought to develop a more accurate model  by introducing nonlinearity into the coupled dipole approximation, and to explain the phenomena in the phase-mismatched atomic medium.\n","tags":["project"]}]
