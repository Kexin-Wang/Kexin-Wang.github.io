Atoms are usually treated as dipoles in the electromagnetic field, but the latest experimental concerned with the collective decay rate conflicts with it.  \nPersonal project sought to develop a more accurate model  by introducing nonlinearity into the coupled dipole approximation, and to explain the phenomena in the phase-mismatched atomic medium.\n","tags":["project"]}]
